Will you listen now,
while I sing
of wealthy kings
who I now will tell of.

Sigmund I now name
Vølsung's son,
it was the young Hjørdis,
she was his wife.

So gladly they drank,
in the kingdom at Yule-tide
then they set out to assert
their throne.

Suddenly, war came to
their highly hall,
so bravely they defended
the mountains of this rich king.

Here there were so many
might men around
the war went to 
King Júka's land.

The war went to
King Júka's land;
there their battles took place
on the southern sea-strand.

They rode to battle,
none returned home,
outlived by Hjørdis
in both sorrow and pain.

They rode to battle,
losing their life,
outlived by Hjørdis:
Sigmund's wife.

Hjørdis puts on a
blue coat
then she goes onto the battlefield
where Sigmund lays.

"Lie still now, Sigmundur,
my sweetheart,
it is at a sorrowful time
that I have come to see you.

Hear this, brave Sigmund,
my sweetheart,
is there any green herb that could heal
your wounds?"

"Later you must, Hjørdis,
find that cure,
so you can give me the medicine,
the plant that could heal my wound.

Hunding's sons, in battle,
they caused me this harm,
poison was on the sword
that they bore against me.

When I got
the first wound,
asundur broke my good sword
in two it went.

When I got
the second wound,
it stung in the heart
as it became inflamed.

You shall take these
two sword pieces
bring them to the smith
for our young son to have!

That child which you bear,
that child is a boy,
you will bring him up well
you will give him Sjúrður as a name.

Of truth I
tell now to you:
This same son
shall avenge my death.

Regin the smith lives
beyond the river,
you shall give him
these two sword pieces.

Frænur is the name of the dragon
in Glitraheiði he lays,
Regin, he is a good smith,
however he is loyal to none.

I can, Hjørdis,
no longer talk with you,
it is my time of death,
it is approaching quickly.

Greeting, Hjørdis turned
away from Sigmund,
all of her maidens
stood by her side.

All of her maidens
stood with her,
when the lady Hjørdis
fell unconscious.

It was then as it often is,
when soon:
the king passed away
on that same night.

Hjørdis did not spare
more than she had to,
a coffin of pure gold
she let Sigmund rest in.

A coffin of pure gold
she let Sigmund rest in.
a cross of scarlet-silver
it bore as the mark.

Eastwardly under the hill,
where men would roam this world,
they buried that bright man
down into the dark soil.

Eastwardly under the hill,
where men would roam then,
dark is this sad day
to go down into the soil.

Greeting, Hjørdis left now
to sit in her hall,
king Hjálprek was the first
to visit the lady.

King Sigmund
left Hjørdis behind,
King Hjálprek
married her afterwards.

The lady was alone baring that child,
waiting nine months,
until the time came
she gave birth to a son so bold.

The lady was alone baring that child,
for nine months she was,
until her time came
she gave birth to a son so beautiful.

It was then as it often is,
when soon:
the lady walked to the high loft
she gave birth to a young boy.

She wrapped him well in cloth,
when he entered the world,
Sjúrður she herself named him
that gifted boy.

He grew up in the kingdom
of a gifted man,
king Hjálprek
fostered him.

He grew up in the kingdom
quickly and not for long,
he made heavy blows,
he brawled with the king's sons.

He was on the battlefield
under a red shield,
they taught him cunning tactics,
those which that hero wanted to learn.

He was on the battlefield
he was between men,
tearing up a large oaken branch
he sent some of them to Hell.

He was on the battlefield
away from the other boys,
whenever he got angry,
a harmful fight occurred.

The boys sat down,
angry they were:
"You should rather avenge your father
than beat us so sternly."

Sjúrður threw his red shield
down onto the dark soil,
when he heard of his fathers death, 
he became as dark as the soil.

He threw his sword and his armour,
he no longer wanted to play,
walking into see his mother
with pale red cheeks.

"Hear this, my dear mother,
tell me the truth:
what was his name
him who slayed my father?"

"I cannot more truthfully
tell you this,
it was the sons of Hunding
that slayed your father,

It was the sons of Hunding
that slayed your father,
but will not, as long you live
feel the pride of slaying them!

Sjúrður said to his mother
as well as he could:
"Often have young dogs grown
sharp teeth in their mouths."

Hjørdis walks to the chest
where all the gold was kept,
"Here you see the armour
that your father wore when he was killed."

She unlocked the chest
which stored many gold and riches,
she took up the bloodied breastplate,
and throws it to his knees.

She picks up the sword pieces
she passes them to Sjúrður:
"This was given by your dear father,
well unto me.

Take these
two sword pieces,
you must another equally strong
sword with it make.

Regin the smith lives
beyond the river,
you shall give him
these two sword pieces.

Frænur is the name of the dragon
in Glitraheiði he lays,
Regin, he is a good smith,
however he is loyal to none.

Go to the waterfall,
throw a stone into it,
choose yourself the horse
which does not run startled.

He goes to the waterfall,
throws a stone into it,
he took himself the horse
which did not run startled.

He was known in the kingdom,
of all he was the best,
since he was named
Grani, Sjúrður's horse. 

Sjúrður leapt on Grani's back
so early in the morning,
then he rode over the river
to find Regin the smith.

It was the young Sjúrður,
he rode through the gates,
Regin threw all of his smithings
and took his sword to hand.

"Welcome, Sjúrður,
you are such a manly man,
where does your journey stand,
where are you riding to?"

"Listen now, Regin,
here my journey ends,
do this for me, Regin the smith,
smith me a sword.

"Welcome, young Sjúrður,
you are dear to me,
stay at my house this time,
bide this night with me.

"I cannot, Regin the smith,
stay here with you,
king Hjálprek misses me
in his throne-room with him.

You shall smith me a sword
sharp and so pure,
I'll be able to cut through both
iron and stone.

You will smith me a sword
so thoroughly and well,
I'll be able to cut through both
iron and steel.

Regin took the sword
he put it under flames,
for ten nights
he had it in the works.

Ten nights
he had it in the works for,
it was the young Sjúrður
he was riding on another journey.

Sjúrður leapt on Grani's back
so early in the morning,
then he rode over the river
to find Regin the smith.

It was the young Sjúrður,
he rode through the gates,
Regin threw all of his smithings
and took the sword to hand.

"Welcome, Sjúrður,
I have smithed you a sword,
if your courage does not waver
you will be able to fight.

I have smithed you a sword
sharp and so pure,
it will cut through both
stone and iron.

Sjúrður walked up to the anvil
firmly he tested its strength,
at it he struck his good sword
in two pieces it broke.

"You are to die, Regin,
of my will,
for you betrayed me
in your weaponry."

He took both parts of the sword,
threw them to his knees,
while Regin the smith trembled
like a fragile leaf.

He put both of the sword pieces
in his hands afterwards,
while the hands of Regin the smith trembled
like a fragile maid.

"You shall smith me a second sword,
but if you smith it as you have,
you shallk now, Regin the smith,
you will not live.

You shall smith me a sword
so hard will it swing,
I'll be able to cut through both
iron and steel.

"I will smith you a second sword,
and if I do it as such,
the heart of the dragon,
that I add as a stipulation.

Listen, young Sjúrður
I will smith you your sword,
but the heart of the dragon,
I want that in return."

Regin took the sword
he put it under flames,
for thirty nights
he had it in the works.

Thirty nights
he had it in the works for,
it was the young Sjúrður
he was riding on a third journey.

Sjúrður leapt on Grani's back
so early in the morning,
then he rode over the river
to find Regin the smith.

It was the young Sjúrður,
he rode through the gates,
Regin threw all of his smithings
and took the sword to hand.

"Welcome, Sjúrður,
I have smithed you a sword,
if your courage does not waver
you will be able to fight.

I have smithed you a sword
so hard does it swing,
it will cut through both
iron and steel.

Sjúrður took the sword
he struck it with speed,
neither did it break, nor 
so hard was the sword.

So strikes Sjúrður
with such force,
the anvil was cloven asunder
and too was the earth below.

There a stream runs down the hill
not too far away,
Gramm he calls the sword,
that lays on the hall floor.

"Listen, brave Sjúrður
go and find a wife,
for such a warrior
I would give my life!

"Listen to this now, Regin,
this you will tell me:
what is hidden in the heart,
Regin the Smith, of you?

"To that, brave Sjúrður,
I shall say to you:
when you ride to Glitraheiði
let me follow you there!"

"First I will ride into battle,
to find the sons of Hunding,
afterwards I will go to Glitraheiði,
that is what is on my mind.

First I will ride into battle,
to slay the sons of Hunding,
then I will go to Glitraheiði,
for no one can harm me."

It was Sjúrður Sigmundarson
he honoured that promise with pride,
he rode into battle,
he avenged his father's death!

He slayed all of Hunding's sons,
well he came after them all,
he returned for the kingdom for a while,
then he rode to Glitraheiði.

It was Sjúrður Sigmundarson
he travelled through the forest,
he met an old man
sitting down on the grass.

There came a man from the field,
nobody knew who he was,
with a silken cap on his head
and a Finnish bow in hand.

"Listen, young Sjúrður
you are one manly man,
where does your journey stand,
where are you riding to?"

"First I rode to battle
to find the sons of Hunding,
now I ride to Glitraheiði,
such a feat of manliness."

"Nevertheless, brave Sjúrður,
you shall tell me,
who is this feeble man
that has followed you here?

"Regin the Smidur he is called,
he is the dragon's brother,
that is why he is following me
on my journey."

"Who told you to
dig two graves?
dead, must that same man
want to have you!"

"Regin gave me this advice
to dig two graves,
for he is my trusted friend,
with me on this journey.

"If Regin has told you
to dig two graves,
he is the worst of traitors
and he wishes for your death!"

Well must you, Sjúrður
act upon this,
so that you shall not die, 
and will slay this dragon!

If you dig a third,
if you dig it nearby
one sip of poison,
you will live through.

If you dig a fourth,
if you dig it longer forward,
up from that grave
you shall slay him.

If you dig a fourth,
if you dig it close by,
afterwards you shall, Sjúrður,
stand on this earth.

The dragon crawled across the gold
or so I have been told,
Sjúrður leapt on Grani's back
and prepared himself to ride.

Thirty feet was the waterfall,
that the dragon was laying under,
up were both of his wings,
while his body laid on the cliff,

Up were both of his wings,
while his body laid on the cliff,
it was the young Sjúrður,
he swung his sword.

Sjúrður gave a strike so stern
that all thought it a wonder,
then trembled both the leaves and the land
and the foundations of the entire world.

Then trembled both the leaves and the land
and the foundations of the entire world,
Sjúrður swung his bitter blade
and chopped him, down the middle, asunder.

To this, the dragon spoke up
he was laying broken:
"Who is this brave one
who dares to take such a strike?"

"Sjúrður you shall call me,
Sigmund's son,
it was the young Hjørdis,
she gave birth to me."

"Listen to this, young Sjúrður,
to what I say to you:
who guided you this long way
here to me?"

"Regin is your brother,
he showed me the way,
he is the worst of traitors
and he wishes for your death!"

To this, answered the dragon
while he floated in blood:
"You must kill Regin the Smith,
even though he is my brother!"

Now strike Regin the Smith
as you have stricken me,
he is the worst of traitors
and he wishes for your death!

It was Regin the Smith,
speaking out loud,
"Will I now get, Sjúrður,
that which you promised me?"

Sjúrður cut out the heart,
though he had to be precise,
he roasted it on a branch
that was thirty feet long.

Sjúrður burned his hands in the heat,
he put them in his mouth,
and so the birds and animals
were understandable to him.

He heard the wild birds above him speaking,
sitting up on an oak tree:
"You must, Sjúrður,
eat the roast for yourself."

Sjúrður roasted the heart
and took it off of the branch.
Regin started to drink
the dragon's poisonous blood,

Regin started to drink
the dragon's poisonous blood,
Sjúrður gave him a fatal wound
on that spot where he stood.

It was the young Sjúrður,
he swung his sword,
so he cleaved Regin the Smith
asunder, in two pieces.

So much could Sjúrður
take of gold for himself,
for he had slain the dragon Frænur
that laid in Glitraheiði.

Early in the morning,
the shine shone red,
he binds up on Grani's back
twelve chests of gold.

Twelve chests of gold he lay
on both sides, clinking,
himself, he sat on top
or so I have been told.

So Sjúrður began to
ride on top,
Grani burst across the heather
and angry was he then.

The horse runs through the barren landscape,
he did not know the road home,
meaning Sjúrður slept that night
under a bush so cold.

So treads Grani
on stone as if on fields,
such has never been seen
in king Buðli's hall.
